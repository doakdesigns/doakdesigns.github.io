    <h1>Meet the Maker</h1>
    <p><strong>Hi there!</strong> I'm the mind (and hands) behind <em>dOAK Designs</em>. My name is Doak—well, it's my maiden name, but I've always loved how it aligns with “oak,” my favorite kind of tree.</p>
    
    <p>I've been a woodworking hobbyist for over 10 years, based in the San Francisco Bay Area. My initial skills come from high school shop class, and I've refined them through countless YouTube tutorials, trial-and-error projects, and an unending willingness to learn.</p>
    
    <h2>My Woodworking Style</h2>
    <p>
      I focus on <strong>reclaimed wood</strong>. Whether it's salvaged Redwood from a local yard, a scrap from a marketplace, or a piece of driftwood I find on a hike, I see potential in what others consider “trash.”
      I let the natural grain, shape, and knots guide my process. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I build everything from cutting boards and planters to tables and built-in cabinets. I even rebuilt a 1966 Aristocrat camper (with moral support from my two Westies, of course!). My favorite projects, though, are large furniture pieces that get daily use and love. 
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges & Joy</h2>
    <p>
      My biggest challenge? Knowing when to say “done.” I'm a perfectionist, but working with reclaimed materials has taught me to embrace imperfection. There's immense joy in seeing a beat-up board evolve into a functional, beautiful piece of furniture.
    </p>

    <h2>Why dOAK Designs?</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A Nod to My Roots</strong>: The name “Doak” is a playful tribute to my family name (and the mighty oak tree).</li>
        <li><strong>Imperfectly Perfect</strong>: Every reclaimed plank has a story, and I love sharing that story with you.</li>
        <li><strong>Fun & Lighthearted</strong>: This is my side hustle, and I want it to bring me—and you—joy!</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>When I'm not covered in sawdust, I love camping in my vintage camper, exploring the outdoors with my two Westies, and dabbling in all sorts of DIY crafts.</p>
